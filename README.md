**Week 2**

Micropython
Micro-controllers: esp32, microbit.

Types of Micropython IDE: https://thonny.org/, https://codewith.mu/

What?:

* Intepreted programming language created by Guido van Rossum
* First released in 1991
* Available in all platforms

Why?:

* code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace
* object-oriented approach
* aims to help programmers write code clear, logical code for small and large scale Project
