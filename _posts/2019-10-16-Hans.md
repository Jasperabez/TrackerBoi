### Testing of normal stuff
This is just like any other line I think, it's just a paragraph?

1. This is supposed to be a list
2. Like this is the second point
3. And this is third

### Code typing testing

Here I'll explain how to:
1. Code in C++
2. Get good at it

#### Code in C++

before you typed anything in your C++ program, start with this
```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main
{
  //Code here
}
```

The above snippet of codes will be the boilerplate for any of your noob level C++ program

Now, we will follow the tradition of learning a new language, it is a revered long running tradition in programming that has been passed on from generation to generation. Take a deep breath and get ready to sacrifice your soul to debugging.

**REMOVE THE '//Code here' AND ADD IN THE MAGIC SEQUENCE**

```c++
cout << "Hello World" << endl;
```

Congratulation, *you* have transcended to a higher being,
one that is capable of thinking, understanding, and coding.
