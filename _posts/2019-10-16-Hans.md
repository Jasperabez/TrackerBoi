###Learning how to git (collab)

Go to the directory that you want to save the repo in **locally**
Key in the following to clone the whole repo

```git
git clone <insert_git_url>
```

That's it!
With that you will have the whole repo locally in your computer :D

#### Making changes

When you make changes in the repo, follow the following flow.
**Always** fetch before making changes, fetching will get all the other changes that others (might) have done.

```git
git fetch
```

After fetching, you can now do your work!
When you have done doing your work always remember to *Ctrl + S* !
BUT, this will only make changes locally, to save it to your repo, do

```git
git commit
```

This will save your changes into your repo, much like saving your files locally.
However, try to commit in logical chucks of changes as this will help in your version controlling in the future
>Basically, just do it. You'll thank yourself in the future
