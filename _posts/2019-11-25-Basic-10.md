This is an introduction to basic Fan In/Out, Signal Level Conversion and Output in a Microcontroller set-up.

# Fan In / Out

Under construction.

# Transducers

Sensors and transducers are considered as energy conversion devices which receive a physical data such as temperature, pressure or light intensity and generate an electrical signal such as voltage depending on the type of transducer. Transducers can then be divided into two categories: **Active** or **Passive**

### Active 

An active transducer generates electrical signal in response to the physical parameter and does not require electrical energy in doing so.

#### Example: Piezoelectric sensor

### Passive

A passive transducer requires external energy for it's operation. 

#### Example: Photoconductive Devices

#### Switch (On/Off)

The resistive passive sensor changes value (electrical) when the physical quantity (e.a. temperature, force, light etc) changes. These sensors can (generally) be used in combination with an extra resistor, like described above. The most common sensor is a switch. A switch is actually a resistor with two states: infinite and zero. When a switch has to be connected to the analog input of a sensor-interface, the same series resistor as mentioned before is needed.

A good value of the series resistor R1 will be between 10K-50K. In rest situation (switch is not pushed), the output will be +5V. When the switch is pushed, the resistance will be zero (shortcut to gnd) and the output voltage will be 0V.

Things to consider when choosing a transducer:

1. Linearity

2. Sensitivity

3. Dynamic range

4. Repeatability

5. Physical Size

# Output

To interface your Microcontroller(ESP32) and your Electronics(Transducers and Actuators) using micropython make sure your have the micropython environment setup if not you can refer to one of our many guides. In this guide I will showing how to interface **actuators** primarily **LED** and a **DC motor** .

## LED

### Components needed:

1. ESP32

2. 5mm LED (any color except blue or white)

3. Resistor (range 100-200ohms)

4. breadboard (optional)

do take note that ESP32 voltage output is **3.3V**, LED voltage is normally **2V** and our max current is assumed to be **20mA**, hence using formula of **R=V/I** we obtain our optimal range but you can adjust the resistor value accordingly if so desired.

Wire up the LED accordingly, I'm using pin 26 you can choose other pins if so wish

### Code

All code is to be written in main.py file

#### LED On/Off
```python
from machine import Pin
p26 = Pin(26, Pin.OUT)
p26.value(1) 
#P26.value(0) to off
```
As you can see it's just simple On/Off, how about adjusting the brightness?

#### LED On/Off + brightness
```python
from machine import Pin
from machine import PWM
p26 = Pin(26, Pin.OUT)
pwm26 = PWM(p26, freq=1000, duty=512) #LED will turn on at this point
#freq can be adjusted accordingly
#duty value ranges from 0-1023 so 512 is 50% duty cycle
#duty value directly correlate with brightness
```

The adjusting of brightness is done via PWM you can read up more on [Micropython site](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/tutorial/pwm.html).

## DC Motor

### Components needed:

1. ESP32

2. 5V power supply/battery

3. 5V DC Motor

4. 220 Ohm resistor

4. Transistor P2N2222A

5. Diode 1N4148

6. breadboard (optional)

If needed swap out the resistor, transistor, and diode by following this [guide](https://electronicsclub.info/transistorcircuits.htm) by electronics club.

### Schematic

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Basic10/led_fritzdiag.png)
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Basic10/led_circuitdiag.png)

wire up the motor accordingly, instead of using pin 26 I'm using pin 21 here. The reasoning behind using a transistor and external power supply is that the motor have much higher current and voltage requirement than the ESP32 can supply, additionally the diode acts as a flyback diode to reduce back emf from the motor.

### Code

to On/Off or control speed of motor, do refer back to the [LED section](#led-on/off) as its the same. Do however change the pin number to whatever pin that your transistor is connected to.
